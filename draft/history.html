            <p>From Chiper was born</p>
            <p>The earliest known use of cryptography is found in non-standard hieroglyphs carved into the wall of a tomb from <br>the Old Kingdom of Egypt circa 1900 BC. These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, <br>however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers.<br></p>
            <p>Some clay tablets from Mesopotamia somewhat later are clearly meant to protect informationâ€”one dated <br>near 1500 BC was found to encrypt a craftsman's recipe for pottery glaze, presumably commercially <br>valuable.Furthermore, Hebrew scholars made use of simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers (such as the <br>Atbash cipher) beginning perhaps around 600 to 500 BC.<br></p>
            <p>In India around 400 BC to 200 AD, Mlecchita vikalpa or "the art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing<br>of words in a peculiar way" was documented in the Kama Sutra for the purpose of communication between lovers. <br>This was also likely a simple substitution cipher.Parts of the Egyptian demotic Greek Magical Papyri were <br> written in a cypher script.<br></p>
            <p>The ancient Greeks are said to have known of ciphers. The scytale transposition cipher was used by the<br> Spartan military,but it is not definitively known whether the scytale was for encryption, authentication, or avoiding <br>bad omens in speech. Herodotus tells us of secret messages physically concealed beneath wax on wooden <br>tablets or as a tattoo on a slave's head concealed by regrown hair, although <br>these are not properly examples of cryptography per se as the message, once known, is directly readable; <br>this is known as steganography. Another Greek method was developed by Polybius (now called the <br>"Polybius Square"). The Romans knew something of <br>cryptography (e.g., the Caesar cipher and its variations).<br></p>
